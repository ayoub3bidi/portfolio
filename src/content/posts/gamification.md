Gamification seeks to encourage participants' behavior by borrowing elements of games, such as scoring points. Few rigorous studies exist on gamification in software organizations, and several questions have remained unanswered.

Understanding what increases developers' job satisfaction is therefore valuable for organizations. Besides keeping developers happy, organizations may wish to encourage certain types of behavior like sharing code and knowledge. 

This suggests that by gamifying a process, participants’ engagement may increase. While the phrase “engagement with a product or service” in the definition above might imply that participants are end-users or customers, in a software development context these participants are software developers.

## What is Gamification
Gamification is the use of game-design features and gaming principles in situations that are not game-related. It can also be described as a collection of methods and procedures for resolving issues by utilizing or putting to use game mechanics. To better understand gamification, let us take a look at the history of gamification. For thousands of years, games and game-like components have been used to educate, entertain, and engage people. Points, badges, and leaderboards are a few traditional game components.

## Self-Improvement and Participation in Gamified Tasks
SDT (or Self-determination theory) suggests that people have certain psychological needs that need to be satisfied that drive motivation, specifically, autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

While these three factors of SDT offer a comprehensive view to explain motivation, in this study we seek to focus specifically on the question of what might draw developers to a gamification platform.

Prior research suggested that developers are more motivated when they have the desire to learn new skills (Beecham et al. 2008. Dubois and Tamburrelli 2013 also suggested that gamification may motivate developers to learn new technologies.

Given the fast pace of technological advances in the software sector, it is important that developers remain proactive, for example by learning new skills and technologies. Gamified software development challenges offer compelling mechanisms for developers to contribute to productivity and performance and learn new technologies.

## Examples of Gamification
- The gamification of user experience: Gamification strives to assist and inspire consumers to do tasks prompted by services offered by the company. Gamification is one of the most intriguing developments in recent years in user experience design. No matter how serious the duties we complete using applications are, we still favor those mobile activities that make us smile and have fun. For many apps, gamification can be a great option.

User experience designers use different game mechanics to spice up mobile and web experiences. It boosts user interaction, cultivates brand loyalty for the app’s creator, and keeps user loyalty.

- Gamification to learn coding skills: Gamification in education refers to using game-based components, such as point scoring, peer competition, teamwork, and score tables, to increase student engagement, aid in the assimilation of new knowledge, and assess their level of understanding. Programming cultivates a systematic and original approach to problem-solving.

- Gamification to build an agile culture: Agile is an approach that helps project teams offer more value. Companies may use Agile gamification to change and reinforce behaviors simply and enjoyably, assisting the business or organization in achieving agility.

Agile is an approach that helps project teams offer more value. Companies may use Agile gamification to change and reinforce behaviors simply and enjoyably, assisting the business or organization in achieving agility. Agile gamification uses game mechanics and rewards to increase team engagement and instill the required behaviors in team members, especially in an agile development setting.

## Few of the Best Practices of Gamification for 2022
- Gamify employee onboarding to improve retention rates: Innovative businesses use gamification to make onboarding easier. Organizations can improve employee retention rates by gamifying the process. More companies are expected to investigate the usage of gamification in the onboarding process now that benefits have been established.

- Drive adoption of immersive technologies: The ultimate fusion of video game technology and real life, both digital and non-digital, is the metaverse, which merges a virtual world and the physical world. Thanks to the metaverse, users may mingle, work, learn, and play all in one location. Because of its immersive nature, the distinction between real life and virtual reality is muddled.

## Conclusion
Gamification is much more than merely a technique to engage your employees, users, or customers. It is a mindset that ensures even the most routine-based task becomes challenging and rewarding through a healthy sense of competition and urgency.
