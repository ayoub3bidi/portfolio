Artificial intelligence has been making waves in the job market in recent years. With the development of new technology, many industries are shifting towards automation and AI to streamline their processes and increase efficiency. While there’s no denying that AI can help us achieve great things, it’s also important to be aware of its impact on the job market.

## Automation of repetitive tasks
When we talk about AI the first thing that you can think of is getting rid of repetitive tasks like data entry, scheduling appointments, and even some customer service interactions. This automation can lead to increased efficiency and cost savings for businesses. Now many people will think this means that jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by machines, yes this is true but on the other hand, we will have more time to do tasks that require more brain power, and that will increase product quality.

According to a [report by McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages), AI is expected to create 20–50 million new jobs globally by 2030. These new jobs will be in a range of industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, and finance. Some of the new job roles that are emerging as a result of AI include AI Trainers and Teachers, Data Analysts and Scientists, Human-Machine Teaming Managers, and AI Ethics and Policy Specialists.

## Changes to the skills required for jobs
As AI technology becomes more prevalent, the skills required for certain jobs will change. For example, jobs that once required manual labor may now require more technical skills, such as programming and data analysis. This means that workers will need to upskill and retrain in order to stay competitive in the job market.

AI’s effect on entry-level positions and internships may be more immediate than on senior roles. Many of these positions involve more mundane tasks, including sending emails or producing advertising copy. Is it possible that companies will have less need for these positions as AI like ChatGPT improves?

At the same time, people looking for internships are generally younger and may have an easier time pivoting into a field with more job growth. There are thousands of machine learning and AI-related internships online right now, so the development of AI may lead to a net increase in these roles.

It’s incorrect to say AI will only affect more basic, task-oriented work. Technically advanced work, including drafting first drafts of legal documents and computer programming, may quickly fall under the domain of artificial intelligence. In addition, more established employees may see their work schedules and activities shift as AI takes care of repetitive tasks.

## The business outlook
Businesses must identify which tasks can be automated and which cannot. This will enable them to create a strategy for adopting AI tailored to their needs. For example, businesses that rely heavily on data entry and processing may benefit from adopting AI to automate these tasks. Companies that require a lot of creativity and problem-solving may want to invest in training their employees in these skills. It also means enterprises that adapt to these changes avoid being left behind. For example, brick-and-mortar retailers still need to embrace e-commerce that has struggled to compete with online retailers such as Amazon.

Artificial intelligence has been brought to the investing world, as seen by Q.ai. [Q.ai](https://refer.tryq.ai/7u2YpdYVcxb) makes investing easier through tailored Investment Kits, which use AI to analyze and pick stocks and ETFs most likely to increase your profits.

Investing in the artificial intelligence sector has never been easier thanks to Q.ai’s [Emerging Tech Kit](https://learn.tryq.ai/blog/emerging-tech-kit?utm_campaign=Forbes&utm_medium=article&utm_source=Forbes). This Kit identifies the best weekly investments among tech ETFs, technology company stocks, and [cryptocurrencies](https://learn.tryq.ai/articles/cryptocurrency?utm_campaign=Forbes&utm_medium=article&utm_source=Forbes).

## Conclusion
AI is transforming the job market, with both potential benefits and challenges. It may lead to job displacement but also create new opportunities. To adapt, we must invest in education, training, and policies that distribute benefits equitably and protect workers. By embracing change, we can harness the potential of AI for a better future.
