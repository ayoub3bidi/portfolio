Junior developers often find themselves caught in a dilemma between delivering code quickly and ensuring high code quality. While speed of delivery is important to meet deadlines and keep up with the pace of the industry, code quality is crucial for maintaining software integrity and avoiding technical debt.

In this article, we will explore the challenge that junior developers face in finding the right balance between these two opposing priorities and discuss strategies for achieving both speed and quality in their work.

## The Importance of ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô and Consequence in Development
Good developers and development teams answer questions in the context of solving problems. Answering ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô reveals whether actions correspond to an end goal. Understanding consequence defines a good developer and distinguishes technical debt from bad code.

Ignorance of consequence leads to unmanaged complexity that stalls delivery. Pushing ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô and enhancing consequences ensure continuous value and delivery, rather than simply producing or building up technical debt.

## Tips for Striking the Right Balance
1. You do not necessarily need to be ‚ÄúQuick & Dirty‚Äù or ‚ÄúClean & Slow‚Äù‚Äã
Whenever you speak about quality, there is an inherent assumption that it takes longer, don‚Äôt get me wrong: most of the time if you need to have a clean code you need to invest some time in it but not necessarily all the time, you can choose the right balance between the two, there will be times when the velocity takes the priority and others when the quality is needed to avoid future stupid unexpected problems.

So, it‚Äôs like this: getting the balance right between meeting deadlines, shipping features, and writing the best code possible is seriously tricky. Some folks think that the need to get things done and keep clients happy means that clean code patterns take a back seat, while others believe that quality code should be priority number one and that by prioritizing it, you can actually work faster in the long run, even if you miss short-term deadlines.

This is why you need to stop seeing it in black and white and start to see the shades between them.

2. Embrace Everything-as-Code
Developers are less likely to make mistakes when testing or deploying software, for example, when the processes are codified. At the same time, managing everything through code also increases software delivery velocity because it allows processes to be as automated as possible.

So, the point is to try to not take unnecessary extra steps and replace whatever you can with a code-based approach wherever possible. The more you‚Äôre in the actual code the faster your performance and the better your code will be.

3. Stay Humble & Manage Expectations
As a junior developer, it‚Äôs expected to make mistakes and produce inconsistent work while learning. Seek senior advice when needed, but don‚Äôt rely on it entirely. Try to figure things out yourself first and use available resources before asking for help. Take criticism graciously, as code reviews are not personal. Keeping an open mind and considering different approaches is key to becoming a successful developer.

4. Embrace Small Developer Teams
Smaller teams can be more effective for junior developers. This is because smaller teams can often provide more opportunities for learning and growth, as well as more opportunities to contribute to the project. Additionally, smaller teams may be less intimidating for junior developers, as they may feel more comfortable asking questions and seeking help from their colleagues. I am not saying that if you are in a big team you should quit and search for another place to be in a smaller team, but small teams can give you the key to having the balance faster.

5. Use everything on your hand
I am actually used to being against using chat-GPT or any available AI tool you got for junior developers, and the reason was simply that it could be inaccurate or misleading sometimes and it could also kill your googling skills (I think that term will be gone in the next few years üòä and be replaced with ‚Äúprompting‚Äù or something), So whether you like it or not these tools are here to stay.

I highly recommend using them for simple boring tasks so you can gain more time to focus more on your code quality.

## Conclusion
While it is important to write clean, efficient code, it is equally important to meet deadlines and deliver working software. By prioritizing communication, seeking feedback, and continuously learning and improving, junior developers can navigate this challenge and contribute to successful projects. With the right mindset and approach, balancing code quality and speed of delivery can become a strength rather than a weakness.
