# Portfolio  
Welcome to my portfolio ‚ù§ 2023-2024 version.  
Using the way back machine you can see it from [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20221221145406/https://ayoub3bidi.vercel.app/).

## Available Scripts

### Run with NPM

In the project directory, you can run:

```shell
npm run start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Run with Docker

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
Builds the container.  
**Disclaimer**: that will take some time to build.

```shell
docker-compose up
```
Runs the container. You will find the project running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
